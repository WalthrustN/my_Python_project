Process is an instance of a program (example a Python Interpreter)

+ Process can have multiple threads
+ takes advantages of multiple CPU and cores
+ Seperate memory space, memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU bound processing **
+ new process is started independently of other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ 1 GIL/1 process -> avoids gil limitation

Heavyweight
+ Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
+ More memory
+ IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated

GIL = (Global Interpreter Lock)
