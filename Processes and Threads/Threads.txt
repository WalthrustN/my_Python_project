# Threads - an entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as a ' lightweight process ')
A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Lightweight, so starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

+Threading is Limited by the GIL: Only one thread at a time.
+No effect for CPU type tasks
+Not interruptable/ killable
Since threads share the same memory you have to be careful with race conditions that can cause bugs and crashes.
